>This project is primarily focused on extracting real estate information from OnTheMarket.com, a leading property portal in the United Kingdom. Through this initiative, we aim to gather comprehensive data on various properties listed on the platform, including residential and commercial listings, their prices, locations, specifications, and other pertinent attributes.

### Should You Consider Using OnTheMarket for Your Property Search?
OnTheMarket is a United Kingdom property portal similar to Rightmove and Zoopla. In October 2023, it was announced that the firm would be acquired by CoStar Group for Â£99 million. On December 12, the Washington, D.C.-based property data company reported having completed the purchase of OnTheMarket plc. 

User reviews indicate that OnTheMarket has a solid rating of [3.6 stars](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/onthemarket.com) on Trustpilot, which is comparable to [Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/)'s [3.6 stars](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rightmove.co.uk) rating, while [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/) stands at a lower [2.3 stars](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.zoopla.co.uk). This suggests that OnTheMarket has garnered a reasonably positive reception among its users, indicating that many have had satisfactory experiences with the platform.

Overall, using OnTheMarket is considered a good option for anyone looking to navigate the UK property market, backed by a growing company with positive user feedback. If you're searching for a home or investment property, OnTheMarket should definitely be on your list of resources to explore.
